   2. Write a program to create simple calculator using switch statement.
   3. Write a program to find the Maximum of Two Numbers using switch statement
   4. Write a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using a while loop.
      The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
      Example: For input n = 5, the factorial is calculated as 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
   5. Display on the screen the multiplication table for 3.
   6. Write a program where the user enters any positive integer.
      The program then calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user.
      For example: if the user enters the number 3. The program should calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 3, which is 1+2+3, and output the answer 6.
   7. The program should display the following sequence on the screen:7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 91 98.
